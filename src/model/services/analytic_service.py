    AnalyticsService provides a collection of static methods to perform various analytical calculations related to assignments, exams, and grades.

    Methods:
        calculate_assignment_total(assignments: List[Assignment]) -> float: Calculate the total marks for a list of assignments, considering their weighted marks.
        calculate_weight_total(assignments: List[Assignment]) -> float: Calculate the total weight of a list of assignments.
        get_exam_mark(subject: Subject) -> Optional[float]: Retrieve the exam mark for a given subject, if available.
        detect_marking_scale(marks: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]: Detect the marking scale based on the provided marks and return the maximum mark and the scale factor.
        calculate_grade_distribution(marks: List[float], scale_factor: float = 1.0) -> Dict[str, int]: Calculate the grade distribution (HD, D, C, P, F) based on the provided marks and an optional scale factor.
        calculate_exam_requirements(subject: Subject) -> Dict[str, float]: Calculate the exam mark requirements for a subject based on the total mark and assignment marks, and determine if the required exam mark is achievable.
