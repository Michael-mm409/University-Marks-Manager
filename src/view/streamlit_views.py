"""Main Streamlit view controller - orchestrates UI components.

This module provides the primary view controller for the University Marks Manager
application, implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The StreamlitView
class orchestrates all UI components, manages page layout, and coordinates user
interactions through a clean, organized interface.

The view controller follows a component-based architecture where specialized
components handle specific UI concerns, promoting modularity, maintainability,
and separation of responsibilities across the application interface.

Classes:
    StreamlitView: Main application view controller implementing MVC pattern

Architecture:
    The StreamlitView implements a hierarchical component structure:

    Main Controller:
        â””â”€â”€ StreamlitView: Primary view orchestration and layout management
            â”œâ”€â”€ NavigationBar: Application navigation and routing
            â”œâ”€â”€ OverviewDisplay: Subject overview and summary information
            â”œâ”€â”€ AnalyticsDisplay: Performance analytics and visualizations
            â”œâ”€â”€ SubjectForms: Subject management form components
            â”œâ”€â”€ AssignmentForms: Assignment management form components
            â””â”€â”€ SettingsForms: Application settings and configuration

Key Features:
    - Component-Based Architecture: Modular UI components with clear responsibilities
    - MVC Pattern: Clean separation between view, model, and controller layers
    - Responsive Layout: Three-tab interface with organized content sections
    - Consistent Navigation: Integrated navigation system with state management
    - Error Handling: Graceful degradation when data is not available

Dependencies:
    - streamlit: Core UI framework for web application interface
    - controller.app_controller.AppController: Main application controller
    - view components: Specialized UI components for different application areas

Example:
    >>> from controller.app_controller import AppController
    >>> from view.streamlit_views import StreamlitView
    >>>
    >>> # Initialize and render application
    >>> controller = AppController()
    >>> view = StreamlitView(controller)
    >>> view.render()  # Renders complete application interface

    """Main Streamlit view class implementing the MVC pattern for UI orchestration.

    This class serves as the primary view controller for the University Marks Manager
    application, coordinating all UI components and managing the overall application
    layout. It implements a component-based architecture where specialized components
    handle specific UI concerns.

    The view controller follows the dependency injection pattern, receiving the
    application controller to coordinate with business logic and data persistence
    layers. All UI components are initialized with the controller to maintain
    consistent data access patterns.

    Attributes:
        controller: Main application controller for business logic coordination
        navigation: NavigationBar component for application routing
        overview_display: OverviewDisplay component for subject summaries
        analytics_display: AnalyticsDisplay component for performance analytics
        subject_forms: SubjectForms component for subject management
        assignment_forms: AssignmentForms component for assignment management
        settings_forms: SettingsForms component for application configuration

    Layout Structure:
        Application Interface:
            â”œâ”€â”€ Title: University Marks Manager application header
            â”œâ”€â”€ Navigation: Year, semester, and subject selection controls
            â”œâ”€â”€ Content Tabs: Three-tab interface for different application areas
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Overview Tab: Subject summaries and key metrics
            â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Manage Tab: CRUD operations for subjects and assignments
            â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Analytics Tab: Performance analysis and visualizations
            â””â”€â”€ Error States: Informational messages for missing data

    Design Principles:
        - Component Composition: UI built from specialized, reusable components
        - Separation of Concerns: Each component handles specific UI responsibilities
        - Dependency Injection: Controller provided to all components for consistency
        - Error Handling: Graceful degradation with informative user messages
        - Responsive Design: Organized layout that works across different screen sizes

    Example:
        >>> controller = AppController()
        >>> view = StreamlitView(controller)
        >>> view.render()
        >>> # Renders complete application with navigation, tabs, and components
