"""Analytics tab display components - legacy wrapper and migration coordinator.

This module serves as a legacy wrapper and migration coordinator for the analytics
display system. It provides backward compatibility while directing all functionality
to the new modular analytics system located in the analytics subdirectory.

Migration Strategy:
    The University Marks Manager transitioned from a monolithic analytics display
    to a modular system with specialized components. This wrapper ensures existing
    code continues to work while new development uses the improved architecture.

Architecture Transition:
    Old: Single analytics_display.py handling all analytics functionality
    New: Modular system with specialized display components:
        ├── analytics/analytics_display.py (coordinator)
        ├── analytics/grade_status_display.py (grade overview)
        ├── analytics/assignment_charts_display.py (visualizations)
        ├── analytics/performance_display.py (trends and metrics)
        └── analytics/exam_management_display.py (exam interface)

Deprecation Plan:
    Phase 1: Legacy wrapper maintains compatibility (current state)
    Phase 2: Update all import statements to use new analytics system directly
    Phase 3: Remove this wrapper file once migration is complete

Example:
    >>> # Current usage (legacy compatibility)
    >>> from view.components.displays.analytics_display import AnalyticsDisplay
    >>> display = AnalyticsDisplay(controller)
    >>> display.render()

    >>> # Future usage (direct new system access)
    >>> from view.components.displays.analytics.analytics_display import AnalyticsDisplay
    >>> display = AnalyticsDisplay(controller)
    >>> display.render()

class AnalyticsDisplay:
    """Legacy wrapper for the new modular analytics system.

    This class provides backward compatibility during the transition from the
    monolithic analytics display to the new modular architecture. It acts as
    a transparent proxy, delegating all functionality to the improved system
    while maintaining the same external interface.

    Design Purpose:
        - Maintains API compatibility during system migration
        - Provides seamless transition without breaking existing code
        - Enables gradual migration to new system components
        - Centralizes legacy support in a single location

    Attributes:
        new_analytics: Instance of the new modular analytics display system

    Migration Benefits:
        - Zero downtime migration: existing code continues working
        - Gradual transition: components can be updated incrementally
        - Risk reduction: new system can be thoroughly tested before cutover
        - Clean separation: legacy and new systems are clearly delineated

    Wrapper Pattern:
        This follows the wrapper/adapter pattern, providing interface
        compatibility while delegating implementation to a new system.

    Example:
        >>> # Legacy code continues to work unchanged
        >>> controller = AppController()
        >>> analytics = AnalyticsDisplay(controller)
        >>> analytics.render()  # Automatically uses new system
    """

    def __init__(self, controller: AppController) -> None:
        """Initialize legacy wrapper with controller delegation.

        Creates an instance of the new analytics system and stores it for
        delegation. This maintains the same constructor signature as the
        original analytics display for seamless compatibility.

        Args:
            controller: Main application controller providing data access

        Delegation Strategy:
            Rather than reimplementing functionality, this wrapper creates
            an instance of the new system and delegates all operations to it.
            This ensures the latest features and bug fixes are always used.

        Example:
            >>> controller = AppController()
            >>> display = AnalyticsDisplay(controller)  # Creates wrapper
            >>> # Internally creates NewAnalyticsDisplay(controller)
        """
        # Delegate to the new modular analytics system
        self.new_analytics: NewAnalyticsDisplay = NewAnalyticsDisplay(controller)

    def render(self) -> None:
        """Render analytics interface using the new modular system.

        Provides the same render() interface as the original analytics display
        while delegating all functionality to the new system. This ensures
        existing code works unchanged while benefiting from improvements.

        Delegation Process:
            1. Legacy code calls render() on this wrapper
            2. Wrapper delegates to new_analytics.render()
            3. New system handles all analytics display logic
            4. User sees improved interface without code changes

        Benefits of Delegation:
            - No code duplication between old and new systems
            - Automatic access to new features and bug fixes
            - Consistent behavior across legacy and new interfaces
            - Simplified maintenance with single implementation

        Example:
            >>> display.render()  # Same interface as before
            >>> # Internally calls self.new_analytics.render()
        """
        # Delegate rendering to the new analytics system
        self.new_analytics.render()

MIGRATION GUIDE FOR DEVELOPERS:

Current State (Working):
    from view.components.displays.analytics_display import AnalyticsDisplay
    display = AnalyticsDisplay(controller)
    display.render()

Future Target (Post-Migration):
    from view.components.displays.analytics.analytics_display import AnalyticsDisplay
    display = AnalyticsDisplay(controller)
    display.render()

Migration Steps:
    1. Update import statements to use analytics.analytics_display
    2. Test thoroughly to ensure compatibility
    3. Remove this legacy wrapper file
    4. Update documentation and examples

Benefits After Migration:
    - Direct access to new modular components
    - Cleaner import structure
    - Elimination of legacy wrapper overhead
    - Full access to new system capabilities
