"""Controller handlers package for business logic orchestration.

This package provides specialized handler classes that implement the Command pattern
for processing user actions and coordinating business operations in the University
Marks Manager application. Each handler encapsulates specific domain logic and
manages the interaction between the view layer and the model layer.

Handler Architecture:
    The handlers package implements a command-based architecture where each handler
    is responsible for a specific domain area:

    Assignment Operations:
        - AssignmentHandler: Assignment CRUD operations and validation

    Subject Management:
        - SubjectHandler: Subject lifecycle and relationship management

    Analytics Processing:
        - AnalyticsHandler: Performance calculations and statistical analysis

Design Pattern:
    Command Pattern Implementation:
        - Each handler encapsulates a request as an object
        - Decouples the object that invokes the operation from the object that performs it
        - Enables parameterization of clients with different requests
        - Supports queuing, logging, and undoable operations

Handler Responsibilities:
    AssignmentHandler:
        - Assignment creation, modification, and deletion
        - Mark validation and business rule enforcement
        - Assignment-subject relationship management
        - Grade calculation and percentage conversion

    SubjectHandler:
        - Subject creation and lifecycle management
        - Assignment collection management within subjects
        - Subject-level calculations and analytics
        - Data validation and integrity enforcement

    AnalyticsHandler:
        - Performance trend analysis and visualization data preparation
        - Statistical calculations for assignments and subjects
        - Grade distribution analysis and reporting
        - Progress tracking and target achievement calculations

Key Features:
    - Separation of Concerns: Each handler focuses on specific business domain
    - Command Pattern: Encapsulated operations with clear interfaces
    - Validation: Business rule enforcement at the controller level
    - Error Handling: Comprehensive error management and user feedback
    - Type Safety: Full type annotation and validation support

Design Benefits:
    - Modularity: Clear separation of different business operations
    - Testability: Isolated handlers enable focused unit testing
    - Maintainability: Changes to business logic contained within handlers
    - Extensibility: New handlers can be added without affecting existing code
    - Consistency: Standardized approach to business operation handling

Usage Patterns:
    >>> from controller.handlers import AssignmentHandler, SubjectHandler, AnalyticsHandler
    >>>
    >>> # Handler initialization with dependencies
    >>> assignment_handler = AssignmentHandler(data_persistence, semester)
    >>> subject_handler = SubjectHandler(data_persistence, semester)
    >>> analytics_handler = AnalyticsHandler(semester)
    >>>
    >>> # Command execution through handlers
    >>> assignment_handler.create_assignment("CSCI251", "Assignment 1", 18.5, 20.0)
    >>> subject_handler.add_subject("CSCI251", "Advanced Programming")
    >>> analytics_data = analytics_handler.generate_performance_analytics()

Integration:
    Handler classes integrate with:
    - View Layer: Process user actions from Streamlit interface
    - Model Layer: Orchestrate domain entity operations and persistence
    - Service Layer: Coordinate complex business operations and calculations
    - Repository Layer: Manage data persistence and retrieval operations
    - Validation Layer: Enforce business rules and data integrity

Error Handling Strategy:
    Handlers implement comprehensive error handling:
    - Input Validation: Parameter validation before processing
    - Business Rule Enforcement: Domain constraint validation
    - Data Integrity: Consistency checks across operations
    - User Feedback: Clear error messages for user interface
    - Logging: Operation tracking for debugging and auditing

Performance Considerations:
    - Lazy Loading: Data loaded only when required for operations
    - Caching: Frequently accessed data cached at handler level
    - Batch Operations: Multiple related operations grouped for efficiency
    - Validation Optimization: Early validation to prevent expensive operations
    - Memory Management: Efficient object lifecycle management

Example:
    >>> from controller.handlers import AssignmentHandler, SubjectHandler, AnalyticsHandler
    >>> from model.repositories import DataPersistence
    >>> from model.domain import Semester
    >>>
    >>> # Handler initialization
    >>> persistence = DataPersistence()
    >>> semester = Semester("2024 Session 1")
    >>>
    >>> assignment_handler = AssignmentHandler(persistence, semester)
    >>> subject_handler = SubjectHandler(persistence, semester)
    >>> analytics_handler = AnalyticsHandler(semester)
    >>>
    >>> # Business operations through handlers
    >>> try:
    ...     # Subject management
    ...     subject_handler.create_subject("CSCI251", "Advanced Programming")
    ...
    ...     # Assignment operations
    ...     assignment_handler.add_assignment("CSCI251", {
    ...         "name": "Assignment 1",
    ...         "mark": 18.5,
    ...         "weight": 20.0,
    ...         "grade_type": "assignment"
    ...     })
    ...
    ...     # Analytics generation
    ...     analytics = analytics_handler.calculate_subject_analytics("CSCI251")
    ...     performance_data = analytics_handler.generate_performance_trends()
    ...
    ... except ValueError as e:
    ...     print(f"Validation error: {e}")
    ... except Exception as e:
    ...     print(f"Operation failed: {e}")
